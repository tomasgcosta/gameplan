# Description

This is a solo project that I am building on my own terms, focusing more on the front end aspect of development as I am, by nature, more back end oriented. I am building this project as I go!


# Updates
This is a list of updates that I will be adding at my own discretion, depending on the time I have available:
- Create login/signup authentication;
- Create URL for ingame shops in order to guarantee a checkout API for integration purposes;
